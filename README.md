# RAD_206_final_DBSim
 DBS simulator and Brain anatomy learning Application

 The Enclosed project provides a mixed-reality and haptic-enabled platform developed on Unity.

 Setup Instructions for Unity can be found here https://unity.com/

 Setup Instructions for the Windows Hololens and associated Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity

 Additionally, this project uses the Phantom Omni Haptic Device developed by 3D Systems, and the associated Unity asset Haptics Direct for Unity V1 can be found here https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/haptics-direct-for-unity-v1-197034

 Holographic remoting must be used to deploy the app to the hololens. A tutorial can be found here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/preview-and-debug-your-app?tabs=openxr

 The main menu scene should be loaded and the app deployed. From there the user can use the in game menus to navigate to the learning scene (interactively explore the anatomy of the brain) and the training scene (practice DBS electrode placement surgery).

 Enjoy!!
